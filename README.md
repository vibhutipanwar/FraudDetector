Fraud Detection, Alert, and Monitoring (FDAM) System
Overview
The Fraud Detection, Alert, and Monitoring (FDAM) System is a hybrid solution designed to identify fraudulent activities in payment gateways. Combining rule-based logic and machine learning models, the system enables real-time fraud detection, transaction monitoring, and insightful analytics.

Features
Real-Time Fraud Detection: Leverages rule-based and AI-driven methods to detect fraudulent transactions instantly.

Customizable Rules: Define and adjust fraud detection rules dynamically.

Machine Learning Models: Advanced models like XGBoost and Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.

Interactive Dashboard: Visualize fraud trends, transaction data, and model performance.

Scalable Infrastructure: Dockerized deployment for seamless scalability and performance optimization.

Technology Stack
Backend:

FastAPI, MongoDB, Redis, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Frontend:

React (TypeScript), D3.js, Recharts

Infrastructure:

Docker, Redis Pub/Sub, Material-UI
